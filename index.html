    <h2>BREAKING: Sleeper Cell Activity Suspected in Prosper, Texas</h2>
    <p class="byline">By J.D. Wallace | June 28, 2025</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Prosper, TX</span> – Federal officials have reportedly launched a discreet investigation into suspected Iranian-linked sleeper cell operations in the quiet North Texas suburb of Prosper, according to sources familiar with the matter.</p>

    <p>While no official statements have been released, multiple agencies are said to be tracking encrypted communications and suspicious banking activities tied to new arrivals in the community. At least three individuals of Middle Eastern origin and one of Indian descent have drawn attention for frequent out-of-state travel and irregular social patterns.</p>

    <p>“This is not about profiling,” said one anonymous DHS source. “It’s about patterns. We’re seeing the same red flags we’ve seen before in sleeper staging zones.”</p>

    <p>Prosper has experienced rapid growth in recent years, with upscale housing and tech jobs attracting thousands of new residents. But some analysts believe this very growth may be what makes it attractive for low-profile foreign actors.</p>

    <p>“You don’t need a bunker or back alley anymore,” said a retired military intelligence analyst. “You need access, cover, and quiet. Prosper has all three.”</p>

    <p>Local officials were unaware of the investigation when contacted, but the Collin County Sheriff's Office issued a statement encouraging residents to report any suspicious activity through official channels.</p>

    <p>This comes just days after ICE detained 11 Iranian nationals in other parts of the South, several with alleged links to the IRGC. Whether the Prosper case is connected remains unclear.</p>

    <p>More details as the story develops.</p>
